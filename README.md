# Tennis-Final-Project
Our primary interest is to see which type of court conditions gives the best tennis score results. This would include features such as whether the match was indoor/outdoor, 
court surface, and score. We aim to predict if there is a correlation between the number of wins, and court type on which a game was played on.
